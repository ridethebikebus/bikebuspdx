BikeBusPDX aims to promote biking as a healthy and eco-friendly commuting option for school children.
The program organizes groups of kids to ride their bikes together to school on a weekly basis.
By fostering camaraderie and providing a sense of security, the Bike Bus encourages kids to embrace cycling as a fun and social activity.
This initiative not only reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions,
but also instills a lifelong habit of active transportation in young individuals.

# History of the Bike Bus (Bike Train)

The current incarnation of the Bike Bus is not Portland's first! That honor goes to the **Bike Train** movement from 2010.

> [Biketrainpdx.org](http://www.biketrainpdx.org) was started by Kiel Johnson in 2010 as a way to create a citywide community for bike trains. After graduating from college and unable to find a job doing what he wanted to do Kiel decided to just go out and do it. So in 2009, Kiel helped organize a bike train from Beach School which proved very successful. Using that as a model Kiel tried to spread bike trains to schools throughout Portland. The goal was to have a bike train running at every single school in Portland.

# Bike Buses Today

The current Bike Bus movement in Portland was started by [Sam Balto on Earth Day 2022 at Alameda Elementary](https://bikeportland.org/2022/04/22/portlands-bike-bus-for-earth-day-nets-huge-turnout-in-alameda-neighborhood-video-352657). It was part of a trend of Bike Buses sprouting up throughout North America and Europe. Since then, Sam has started running the non-profit [Bike Bus World](https://bikebus.world) to evangelize and support Bike Buses everywhere.

There are Bike Buses at almost two dozen Portland schools, led primarily by parent volunteers. Our Bike and Walking Buses were awarded $2.1m in grants from
the [Portland Clean Energy Fund](https://bikeportland.org/2024/10/31/walking-school-buses-poised-for-growth-thanks-to-pcef-grant-391014) and the [Federal government](https://bikeportland.org/2024/11/15/bike-and-walking-school-buses-win-big-with-federal-grant-for-north-portland-391343) to grow existing success and open new frontiers.
