BikeBusPDX aims to promote biking as a healthy and eco-friendly commuting option for school children.
The program organizes groups of kids to ride their bikes together to school on a weekly basis.
By fostering camaraderie and providing a sense of security, the Bike Bus encourages kids to embrace cycling as a fun and social activity.
This initiative not only reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions,
but also instills a lifelong habit of active transportation in young individuals.
