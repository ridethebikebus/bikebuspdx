          <p>Commissioner Mapps & Director Williams:</p>

          <p>
            We, the undersigned, are thankful for your support for HB
            3014 to expand Bike Buses and Walking School Buses across
            Oregon. We strongly urge the City of Portland and Portland
            Bureau of Transportation to
            implement a "<strong>Safer School Streets Pilot</strong>" to ensure the
            success of this innovative and impactful new program. With
            the proven benefits of active transportation for our
            students, our parents, and the environment, supporting this
            pilot will help achieve our city's vision for a healthier
            and more sustainable future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year the Bike Bus program hosted over 100 rides at 14
            participating schools. This movement has captured national
            media attention,
            with
            <a href="https://tiktok.com/@movingbacktoklickitat/video/7151081844425985326" target="_blank">millions of views on social media</a>, and
            appearing on
            <a href="https://youtu.be/zNOb377piC8" target="_blank">NBC
              Nightly News </a>,
            <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/family/bike-buses-kids-school-commute-rcna51747" target="_blank">The
              Today Show</a>,
            <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyClarksonTV/status/1594866000045826048" target="_blank">Kelly Clarkson Show</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/10/11/bike-bus-school-sam-balto/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>.
            At a time when we
            see higher rates of isolation, negative impacts of physical
            inactivity, and learning loss in children, the Bike Bus gets
            students engaged with one another, moving, and excited to
            learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            When parents are hesitant to allow their children to walk or bike to school, it creates a vicious cycle: more parents driving means more cars, leading to less safe streets, which leads to more parents driving. Your courage and leadership are critical to reversing this harmful cycle. Investing in the Safer School Streets Pilot will not only enhance the safety, physical health, and academic performance of our children, but also contribute to the overall sustainability and livability of our city by reducing traffic, carbon emissions, and promoting community connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Safer School Streets Pilot should consist of:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Placing permanent diverters (concrete planters) at the
                locations established during PBOT's
                "<a href="https://www.portland.gov/transportation/safestreetspdx/what-slow-streets-program"
                    target="_blank">Slow Streets</a>"
                pilot, which prioritized equity across neighborhoods
                (See Appendix A).
              </li>
              <li>
                Lowering the maximum threshold for Neighborhood
                Greenways (NG) to 500 vehicles/day rather than the
                current maximum of 2,000 vehicles/day (Source:
                <a href="https://www.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2022/ng_assessment_report_executivesummary.pdf"
                   target="_blank">Neighborhood Greenway Assessment Report</a>).
              </li>
              <li>
                Reducing speeds on Neighborhood Greenways and Safe
                Routes to Schools (SRTS) to 15 MPH, where feasible;
                placing Advisory "15 MPH / Shared Street” signs on
                remaining NGs/SRTS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Establishing a clear process for
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/y2GaXWD5rho" target="_blank">School Street</a>" permits
                to allow streets in front of and surrounding schools to
                be closed to vehicle traffic during drop-off and pick-up
                hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                Placing “No Turn on Red” signs at all signals intersecting Neighborhood Greenways/SRTS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Installing
                "<a href="https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/curb-extensions/gateway/"
                    target="_blank">curb extensions</a>" with planters and paint on
                Neighborhood Greenways/SRTS to reduce crossing distances
                and improve sightlines for students and parents.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adding fixed speed cameras on High Crash Corridors (e.g. 82nd Ave) adjacent to schools.
              </li>
              <li>
                Funding a $75,000 grant for Portland State University's
                TREC program to measure the impact of Bike Bus and
                Walking School buses on student's physical activity,
                learning outcomes, and transportation pollution.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            These small investments will pay huge dividends. Regular physical activity enhances cognitive abilities, attention, memory, and ultimately improves learning outcomes for children (1). Additionally, physical activity helps regulate mood and is effective in helping students with depression, anxiety and ADHD (2). Safer streets allow children to realize their independence through walking or biking to school on their own and with their friends. Investing in the Safer School Streets Pilot will have a real, positive and lasting impact on our children.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Bike Bus student Isla Downard puts it, “It's like riding on an ocean of joy. You know it’s going to be the highlight of your day, and you’re going to arrive at school having such a sense of community.” PE Teacher "Coach" Sam Balto shared, “Kids entering the [school] building on Bike Bus mornings are calmer. The kids enter quicker and are just more excited for the day than other mornings. It’s well researched that being physically active in the morning, kids do better academically, get in trouble less, and have better social relationships. The benefits of active transportation are tremendous.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We urge PBOT and the City of Portland to allocate the small, but necessary resources to support the "Safer School Streets Pilot" and to bolster the Bike Bus program in our city. By doing so, we can further demonstrate our commitment to the well-being and development of our children while working towards a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable future for Portlanders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sincerely,
          </p>
