On February 24th, 2025, leaders from Bike Bus PDX [were invited to testify by Councilor Koyama Lane to the City's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee](https://bikeportland.org/2025/02/25/bike-bus-group-presses-city-council-for-safer-neighborhood-streets-392938).

We were announcing a **resolution request for a pilot establishing a maximum of 500 car trips per day on 25 Neighborhood Greenways with Bike Bus routes.**

We are honored and thrilled with the support so far from the community,
and are inviting more folks to step up and sign up.
