Earlier today, FOUR Portland Bike Bus leaders were at City Hall supporting the Portland Bureau of Transportation's
[Fixing Our Streets 3](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/fixing-our-streets/proposal-2024-2028) proposal.
This is a continuation of the $0.10/gallon gas tax, passed in 2016 and 2020, that provides important street improvements,
especially for schools.

Especially of note to Portland Bike Buses is that diverters are a specific type of modal filter PBOT will install.
This is a real moment of maturity for PBOT and we commend them for calling out diverters,
which are an important ask of our "[Safer School Streets](https://www.bikebuspdx.org/letter)" letter.

Check out Sam Balto, of the Alameda Bike Bus, speaking at PBOT's press conference: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk_gdb-543E&t=582s>
