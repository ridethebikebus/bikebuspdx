Bike Buses are a student-powered movement transforming how families get to school â€” building safety, joy, health, and stronger neighborhoods.

So we're excited that May 19th kicks off "Bike Bus Week," which is part of "[Walk and Bike to School and Work Week](https://www.portland.gov/council/districts/3/tiffany-koyama-lane/events/2025/5/19/walk-bike-school-work-week-celebration)"
being proclaimed by Mayor Keith Wilson, with remarks and a resolution from Councilor Koyama Lane.

We are inviting local leaders of all types, from Principals and PPS staff,
to advocates and associations, to City, County, and State electeds, to:

- Join a Bike Bus at a school near you, and/or
- Meet local bike bus leaders

The Bike Bus route map is available [here](/bike-buses). Find a bus you want to ride,
and email <a href="mailto:ride@bikebuspdx.org">ride@bikebuspdx.org</a> (or the listed contact info)
to coordinate a ride.

If you can't make a ride, we'd still love to chat about Bike Buses.
Please email <a href="mailto:ride@bikebuspdx.org">ride@bikebuspdx.org</a> to find some time to chat.
